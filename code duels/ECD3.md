1. LeetCode 42: Trapping Rain Water
2. GFG: Trapping Rain Water
</details>

### Problem statement
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Each element in the array represents the height of the wall at that index, and water can be trapped between the walls.

### Return statement
Return the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the walls.

### Example 1:
**Input:** height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:** 
```
     |
 |   || |
_|_|_||_||_|
[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
```
The above elevation map is represented by the array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water are being trapped.

### Example 2:
**Input:** height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]  
**Output:** 9

2. GFG: Maximum Rectangular Area in Histogram
</details>

### Problem statement
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

### Return statement
Return an integer representing the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed by a subset of the histogram's bars.

### Example 1:
**Input:** heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]  
**Output:** 10  
**Explanation:** The largest rectangle is formed by bars at index [2,3] with height 5, area = 5 * 2 = 10.

### Example 2:
**Input:** heights = [2,4]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** Both bars can form rectangles of area 4.

### Example 3:
**Input:** heights = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]  
**Output:** 8  
**Explanation:** The entire histogram forms the largest rectangle.

### Problem statement
There are **N** books, each ith book has `A[i]` number of pages.  
You have to allocate books to **M** students such that the **maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimized**.

Conditions:
- Each book should be allocated to a student.
- Each student gets at least one book.
- Books are assigned in **contiguous order**.

Return the **minimum possible** maximum pages per student.  
Return `-1` if a valid assignment is **not possible**.

### Return statement
The minimum possible value of maximum pages that can be allocated to any student.

### Example 1:
**Input:** books = [12, 34, 67, 90], students = 2  
**Output:** 113  
**Explanation:** Allocate [12, 34, 67] and [90] â†’ max pages = 113 (minimum possible)

### Example 2:
**Input:** books = [5, 17, 100, 11], students = 4  
**Output:** 100

### Starting code

</details>

### Problem statement
<!-- Here explain the problem in detail -->
Let $m$ and $n$ be greater than $1$. In each square of $m \times n$ grid lies a coin with its tail-side up.
A move consists of the following steps:
1. Select a $2 \times 2$ square in the grid;
2. flip the coins in the _top-left_ and _bottom-right_ unit squares;
3. flip the coin in either the _top-right_ or _bottom-left_ unit square.

Given a $m \times n$ grid of such coins, print out all moves it would take so that every coin shows head-up after those moves.


### Output statement
<!-- Here explain what the program should return, or output -->
```math
\begin{aligned}
&i, j &- &TR \\
&i, j &- &BL \\
&i, j &- &TR \\
&&\vdots\end{aligned}
```  

where $i, j$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of top-left square of selected $2 \times 2$ grid; $TR$ and $BL$ determines whether $top-right$ or $bottom-left$ coin is flipped
